TODO Right Now:
 - Add effect to make you jump or slide when you touch the ground if you press the button while not grounded but right before you do like reverse coyote time.
 - Add a skidding effect when coming to a stop after running.
 - Fix being ungrounded only being applied when jumping; it's a big problem.

TODO Very Soon:
 - Make the camera centre on the player and follow them.
 - Start work on displaying a level and its rooms.

TODO Near Future:
 - Do procedural (?) level generation.

TODO Far Future:
 - This is a silly section for now just simply do not worry about it.
